Example: 
 How to create "YourProject" Workspace and Project, from "QuickAI-SDK" Workspace

0.Rename or Make copy of QuickAI-SDK folder to YourProject folder 
1.Under App/YourProject/IAR_Project directory, copy "QuickAI-SDK.ewp" and rename 
  it to YourProject.ewp
2.Open App/YourProject/IAR_Project/QuickAI-SDK.eww
3.Select Project->Add Existing Project and select YourProject.ewp.
  It will automatically open YourProject-Debug pannel on left in a tabbed view
  over QuickAI-SDK - Debug Tab
5.Select the "QuickAI-SDK" tab at the bottom of the Workspace view,
  (it is hidden under YourProject-Debug Tab)
6.Right-click the project (at top root) and select Remove. Only YourProject Tab will be left
7.Close IAR, and choose "save" the workspace
8.Rename the .eww, .ewd, .dep, .ewt files to YourProject.eww, YourProject.ewd, etc
9.Delete all QuickAI-SDK.* files except "QuickAI-SDK.icf" file
  (If you choose to rename this also, the the projects options for 
    Linker -> config file should be changed.)
10.Change to Settings directory and delete all QuickAI-SDK.* files
11.Open YourProject.eww workspace. Remove  "QuickAI-SDK folder" in YourProject-Debug
   project and add YourProject folder as new "group. Add src, inc groups
   under it. Then add files to groups.
   (Note: Renaming "QuickAI-SDK" as "YourProject" will also work as long as all
     the source files are relative to the path.) 
   Make sure the QuickAI-SDK removed else main.c etc files will conflict.
   
12.First time when try to download and debug, there may be a message
   saying,"Un-specified device". Select "Cortex-M4" and OK.

It should download properly.
